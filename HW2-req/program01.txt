The assignment is to code a function that plays the "Who Screams Louder"
and returns a list, which is the final rankings of the game.

Assuming the rules are already understood, it is already possible to start on the algorithm.

First, we have to convert the strings and strip them of any whitespace (spaces or tabs)
they have, because the strings we receive have whitespaces in them,
which we need to ignore.

Once we're done with the whitespace, we can start playing the matches.
To make every pair possible we can use two nested loops:
 - the outer one starts from the first player and ends with
   the second-last player (because once it's the last player's turn,
   he'll have already played with everyone else);
 - the inner one starts from [the player ahead of the outer loop's player]
   and ends with the last player.

We take every pair (outer loop's player, inner loop's player) and make them play.
To dispute a match, we take the two players' sequences and loop them simultaneously.
obtaining two characters. The next step is to get the numeric value of those characters
and calculate the difference, which we will call delta.

Then, to evaluate the winner, we need to make a series of checks.
If the delta is smaller or equal than K, the player with the higher value gets a point,
otherwise, the player with the lower value gets a point.
After looping through every character we count the points, the player with the most points wins.
In the case of a tie, the player with the lowest sum of characters wins.
To avoid computing every time the sum of the characters, an operation that can take time,
we can save the sum somewhere and use it whenever we need it.
In case of a further tie, we put the sequences in alphabetic order,
the player of the first sequence wins.

Once we have the final scores, we can sort the players from the most to the least points.
With this order, we make a list with the starting positions of the players,
which is the solution to the assignment.
