How to find the Sync of a poem:

(Premises)
 - The poem is saved on a file, which we'll have to read
 - We'll have to print the matrix of stresses on a file

1. Read all the lines of the poem from a file, saving them into a vector
2. Filter out blank lines, and remove unnecessary characters from the lines
3. Calculate the stresses for every word for every line, adding a 0 (stress) after every word.
   We'll now have an (incomplete) matrix: the rows are the stresses contained in the corresponding line
4. Complete the matrix by filling with 0's the blank spots
5. It is already possible to print out the matrix on the file, so let's do so
6. Make every combination possible of rows (except where the same row appears twice)
7. Compute the sync for every combination and save them: then compute the even of all values
8. Return the obtained value, rounded down to the 6th decimal place
